                  The present invention relates generally to distributed computing systems, artificial intelligence (AI) model orchestration, and data privacy governance. More particularly, the invention relates to computer-implemented systems, methods, and non-transitory computer-readable media for dynamically evaluating and federating across disparate, heterogeneous artificial intelligence providers using capability scoring and real-time reliability/latency metrics; transforming raw personal data footprints into privacy-preserved, differentially private mathematical representations, zero-knowledge attestations, and synthetic twins for fair-compensation data licensing; executing 24/7 continuous autonomous code monitoring, closed-loop unified diff synthesis, and regression-gated self-healing without human intervention; and preserving cryptographically anchored audit trails, public web brand observations, and verified multi-rail settlement ledgers.

                  In the modern digital economy, vast amounts of personal and behavioral data—such as search history, browsing footprints, e-commerce transactions, location signals, health biometrics, and communication metadata—are harvested continuously by third-party data brokers and platform intermediaries. These intermediaries aggregate, profile, and monetize user data for advertising, machine learning pre-training, and market analytics without the data subject's informed consent, granular governance, or direct monetary compensation.

                  Furthermore, existing systems suffer from critical technical deficiencies: (1) binary all-or-nothing privacy checkboxes that lack calibrated mathematical guarantees; (2) extreme vulnerability of single-provider LLM applications to upstream HTTP 503 service unavailable spikes and 429 quota exhaustion; (3) passive monitoring tools that alert human developers without executing closed-loop self-repair; and (4) lack of verifiable, cryptographic proof-of-query execution and instant multi-rail settlement.
