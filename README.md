# GLORIFIER

**GLORIFIER** is a provider-neutral intelligence orchestration and governed value-execution system.

> **No single AI is hard-coded like the brain.**

GLORIFIER coordinates AI providers, specialist agents, opportunity discovery, connections, evidence, governed execution, settlement verification, and authoritative economic data while keeping the human owner as final authority.

## Linux philosophy as the organizational and architectural role model

**Linux / Unix philosophy is GLORIFIER's architectural role model for intelligence orchestration.**

GLORIFIER applies the same separation-of-concerns pattern to intelligence that operating systems apply to software processes and hardware:

- **Kernel/control plane →** GLORIFIER Control Plane + GEAS
- **Processes →** AI agents, scientists, coding workers, and autonomous services
- **Scheduler →** provider, agent, and compute orchestration
- **Drivers →** provider and integration adapters
- **System calls →** governed GLORIFIER APIs
- **Capabilities →** scoped agent capabilities, tools, and data permissions
- **Isolation →** agent, data, and execution boundaries
- **IPC →** structured agent collaboration and evidence events
- **Filesystem/state →** Neon/PostgreSQL authoritative state and registries
- **Daemons →** 24/7 discovery, monitoring, coding, and recovery workers
- **Signals/events →** event-driven orchestration and evidence triggers
- **Tracing →** observability and cryptographic provenance
- **Hardware abstraction →** replaceable compute resources
- **User/root authority →** human owner final authority

### Linux-inspired design laws

1. Build small, specialized components.
2. Connect components through stable interfaces.
3. Keep providers and infrastructure replaceable.
4. Give every agent only the capabilities it needs.
5. Isolate processes, tools, and data scopes.
6. Prefer observable, event-driven coordination.
7. Keep authoritative state durable and explicit.
8. Fail truthfully rather than inventing a result.
9. Separate intelligence from governance and execution.
10. Keep humans above consequential and irreversible actions.

**Core identity:** GLORIFIER is not a Linux kernel and does not replace an operating system. It is a human-governed, provider-neutral intelligence operating architecture inspired by Linux/Unix principles.

## Six permanent planes

### 1. Human Authority
The human owner remains the final authority for consequential actions.

### 2. Intelligence
AI providers and specialist capabilities are interchangeable resources rather than hard-coded dependencies.

Current provider architecture includes Gemini, OpenAI/GPT, Codex, Meta, Anthropic/Claude, future local models, and the GLORIFIER specialist/agent fleet.

### 3. Mediation + Governance
The **GLORIFIER Mediator** is the provider-neutral coordination layer between intelligence and external systems.

Mediator node types:
- AI provider
- Specialist
- Demand source
- Marketplace
- Execution connector
- Settlement rail
- Evidence system
- Revenue ledger

Governance includes GEAS, GATS, Policy Scientist, Specialist Council, model identity, capability boundaries, authorization controls, risk controls, and human approval gates.

### 4. Execution
Authorized connections can support GitHub, GitHub Actions, Railway, Vercel, APIs, webhooks, marketplaces, and other governed connectors.

Authentication does not imply authorization, and authorization does not imply permission for every action.

### 5. Evidence + Economic Truth
GLORIFIER separates observed information, estimates, qualification, proposals, contracts, invoices, settlements, and verified revenue.

**Core rule: GLORIFIER never invents opportunities, contracts, earnings, payments, ownership, or settlement evidence.**

- Market value ≠ revenue
- Opportunity ≠ contract
- Contract ≠ payment
- Wallet/account balance ≠ verified revenue
- Estimate ≠ actual revenue
- Model output ≠ evidence

Verified revenue requires qualifying external settlement evidence recorded in the authoritative ledger.

### 6. Learning + Continuous Improvement
Discovery, outcomes, telemetry, monitoring, recovery, and verified results feed the improvement cycle without bypassing governance.

## 24/7 Opportunity Discovery

Current configured discovery architecture includes GitHub Issues, GitHub bounty signals, Hugging Face models, Hugging Face datasets, and configurable public/API sources.

Operating loop:

**DISCOVER → FILTER → VERIFY → QUALIFY → EVIDENCE → VALUE → PRIORITIZE → ASSIGN → ACT → MEASURE → LEARN → REPEAT**

Findings can be delegated to registered models/agents and monetization scientists. Discovery is autonomous; consequential external actions remain governed.

## Economic truth lifecycle

**OBSERVED → ESTIMATED → QUALIFIED → PROPOSED → CONTRACTED → INVOICED → SETTLEMENT EVIDENCE → VERIFIED REVENUE**

The authoritative revenue ledger is Neon/PostgreSQL. Revenue records support paid, refunded, disputed, and voided states.

## Connection lifecycle

**DISCOVER → REGISTER → AUTHENTICATE → AUTHORIZE → OPERATE → VERIFY → MONITOR → RECONCILE → SUBSTITUTE → IMPROVE**

Provider replacement is a first-class capability.

## Governance boundary

AI may continuously:
- discover
- analyze
- coordinate
- monitor
- plan
- prepare actions
- recommend improvements

Consequential or irreversible actions remain approval-controlled, including fund movement, withdrawals, trading, irreversible wallet operations, binding financial/legal commitments, ownership changes, and sensitive production actions.

## Current control surfaces

The frontend is organized around focused GLORIFIER control surfaces, including:

- Live Economic Data
- AI CEO
- Mediator
- Intelligence
- Collaboration
- 24/7 Discovery
- AI Models
- Code Sentinel
- Compute
- Accounts & Data
- Marketplace
- Compensation
- Monetization
- Compliance
- Patent / IP
- Clawback Audit
- Verified Revenue
- Connections

The primary landing surface is **GLORIFIER Live Economic Data**.

## Technology

- React + TypeScript
- Node.js + Express
- Neon / PostgreSQL
- GitHub
- GitHub Actions
- Railway
- Vercel
- AI provider adapters
- API / OAuth / webhook integrations
- Capacitor Android build support

Google Cloud is intentionally not a required part of the current architecture.

## Operating objective

**EARN → VERIFY → PAYOUT → REINVEST → GROW → MEASURE → IMPROVE → REPEAT**
